# todolist
The Todo List app is a task management tool with a modern UI. It leverages OOP concepts, inheriting from Qt's QMainWindow class, encapsulating task data/functionality, and utilizing signal-slot connections. Users can input tasks, assign priorities, track status, and sort tasks by priority.
